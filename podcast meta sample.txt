      "title": "The urgency of intersectionality | Kimberlé Crenshaw / Abby Dobson",
      "pub_date_ms": 1479140461000,
      "description": "Now more than ever, it's important to look boldly at the reality of race and gender bias -- and understand how the two can combine to create even more harm. Kimberlé Crenshaw uses the term \"intersectionality\" to describe this phenomenon; as she says, if you're standing in the path of multiple forms of exclusion, you're likely to get hit by both. In this moving talk, she calls on us to bear witness to this reality and speak up for victims of prejudice.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TEDTalks_audio/~4/Y1B8kMkrC3o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

      "description": "Before soldiers are sent into combat, they're trained on how to function in an immensely dangerous environment. But they also need training on how to return from the battlefield to civilian life, says psychologist Hector Garcia. Applying the same principles used to prepare soldiers for war, Garcia is helping veterans suffering from PTSD get their lives back.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TEDTalks_audio/~4/8ILan343jHM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

In conversation with TED Curator Chris Anderson, he describes the patterns of thinking and historical causes that have led to such sharp divisions in America -- and provides a vision for how the country might move forward.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TEDTalks_audio/~4/blts3cgMJgM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

      "description": "On February 10, 2015, Suzanne Barakat's brother Deah, her sister-in-law Yusor and Yusor's sister Razan were murdered by their neighbor in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The perpetrator's story, that he killed them over a traffic dispute, went unquestioned by the media and police until Barakat spoke out at a press conference, calling the murders what they really were: hate crimes. As she reflects on how she and her family reclaimed control of their narrative, Barakat calls on us to speak up when we witness hateful bigotry and express our allyship with those who face discrimination.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TEDTalks_audio/~4/OoWrXaSMTgU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

For the self-described \"business romantic,\" this means designing organizations and workplaces that celebrate authenticity instead of efficiency and questions instead of answers.

      "description": "Why should a good education be exclusive to rich kids? Schools in low-income neighborhoods across the US, specifically in communities of color, lack resources that are standard at wealthier schools -- things like musical instruments, new books, healthy school lunches and soccer fields -- and this has a real impact on the potential of students. Kandice Sumner sees the disparity every day in her classroom in Boston. In this inspiring talk, she asks us to face facts -- and change them.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TEDTalks_audio/~4/EL8fYUMEyCM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",
